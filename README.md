## Voxel-RCNN-OpenPCDet
Final course project for CS-539 Machine Learning Fall '21

### Introduction and Motive 

In today's rapidly automated world, state of the art 2D object detection algorithms have become very robust yeilding high accuracy with great precision. In autonomous driving scenarios, 2D detection is not sufficient as it lacks depth information of the corresponding detections. This data is imperative for making sense of the environment for localization and obstacle avoidance. Thus 3D object detection is needed along with 2D detection. This project improves upon the state of the art 3D object detection algorithm Voxel-RCNN for detection of pedestrians and cyclists along with the original cars that were being detected.

### Dataset 
For testing the perfromace of our improved architecture, we used the standard KITTI dataset which is used as a baseline for all 3D object detection algorithms. This dataset contains 7500 training and 7500 testing instances of RGB camera images and Velodyne LIDAR scans for numerous driving conditions. These instances have ground truth 3D bounding boxes for pedestrians, cyclists and car that we use for training our model.

The dataset is further split into 3 main categories based on the occulusion and trucation of the objects. Those categories are:
- EASY, 
- MEDIUM
- HARD 
where EASY means that the object is clearly visible and HARD means that the object is mostly convered by a wall, pillar etc.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jashmehta20/Voxel-RCNN-OpenPCDet/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
