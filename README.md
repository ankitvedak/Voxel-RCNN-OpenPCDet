## Voxel-RCNN-OpenPCDet
Final course project for CS-539 Machine Learning Fall '21

### Introduction and Motive 

In today's rapidly automated world, state of the art 2D object detection algorithms have become very robust yeilding high accuracy with great precision. In autonomous driving scenarios, 2D detection is not sufficient as it lacks depth information of the corresponding detections. This data is imperative for making sense of the environment for localization and obstacle avoidance.
